Connector/Net 5.0.4  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 5.0.4.

Important Changes
---------------------

* We've added support for MySqlParameterCollection.AddWithValue.  This method should
  be used whenever you are wanting to add a parameter by name and set its value in a
  single method call.  The previous .Add overload is marked as deprecated and will give
  a compiler warning if you continue to use it.
  
* This release includes support for calling stored procedures without having privileges
  on the mysql.proc table.  This is accomplished by adding 'Use Procedure Bodies=false' to
  your connection string.  The default is true (which means by default you still need
  access to mysql.proc).  Since MySQL does not yet support an information schema parameters
  view, the connector has to trust the order of parameters that you set on the command.
  So, to call a procedure using a limited privilege account, set 'Use Procedure Bodies=false'
  on your connection string, add parameters to your command object in the exact same order
  they appear in the procedure definition, and make sure all the parameters have their
  type set.
  
* With 5.0.3, we required that all parameters start with the parameter marker (default is ?).
  This was not fully thought out and has been rolled out in this release.  With this release,
  you can add parameters with or without the leading parameter marker.  One thing to understand
  though is that the IndexOf method of MySqlParameterCollection is still sensitive to the name.
  What this means is that if you add a parameter with the name '?parm1' and then call IndexOf
  with the value 'parm1', it will return -1.
  
* Connecion pooling has been significantly changed in this release.  Now, a semaphore is used
  to control access to the pool.  This significantly reduces CPU time incurred while waiting
  on a connection to free and greatly simplifies the locking code involved.
