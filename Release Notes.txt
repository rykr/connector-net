Connector/Net 5.1.2  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 5.1.2

Binary and VarBinary issues
---------------------------
With 5.1.2, we have reintroduced code to properly return field values as byte[] when 
the field's type is indicated to be binary by the server.  Unfortunately, there are
some scenarios where the connector simply can't tell which is right.  One example
is the 'SHOW PROCESSLIST' query.  The fields returned from this query contain text
data but are incorrectly returned using the binary character set.  This means that
these fields will be returned as byte[].  They can stil be retrieved as strings using
MySqlDataReader.GetString().  Please let us know how this issue affects you.  We
are evaluating adding a connection option to make the past behavior available.

Known Issues
------------
1. Creating a procedure with the name StoredProcedure1 will cause any future attempts
   to create a stored procedure to fail.
