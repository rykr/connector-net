      <p>
      Connector/Net is a managed data provider for the MySQL database system and uses either the .NET framework
      or the Mono frameowork.  While the installer does not require either framework to be installed, the binaries 
      (assemblies) installed do require one of these frameworks.
      </p>
      <h4 class="dtH4">Framework Compatibility</h4>
      <p>
      MySQL Connector/Net is compatible with the Microsoft .NET framework 1.0. and 1.1 and the Mono framework 
      versions 1.0 and later.  The connector can also be used successfully with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2002 and
      2003 and Borland C# Builder and Delphi.
      </p>
      <h4 class="dtH4">MySQL Server Compatibility</h4>
      <p>
      MySQL strives to make MySQL Connector/Net compatible with as many publicly available versions of MySQL as possible.  
      The current policy is that Connector/Net will be compatible with all production quality versions of MySQL and the 
      latest pre-release of any future version.  Essentially, it is currently compatible with all production versions of 
      MySQL 3.23 and later, 4.0.x and later, 4.1.7 and later, and 5.0.2 (pre-release).
